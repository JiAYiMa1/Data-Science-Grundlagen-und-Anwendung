 Praktikum Data Science Grundlagen und Anwendung WiSe2021/22

 ## Course contents ##
In this course, we will not go into the mathematical details of those approaches (Why they work as they work), but rather get an idea of what concept to use when confronted with the evaluation of data. That is, you will learn the 
basics in statistical evaluation, data visualization, data acquisition, data management and handling, and applied methods of machine learning.

 ## Project ##
 ### P4Update Flow Update Time ###
Networks are in a constant state of change. Here change means that network traffic are re-routed through different sets of intermediate points, such as switches or vantage points. Using P4, the classical controller algorithms could be
offloaded into data plane, and be realized flexibly by means of P4. But the efficiency is still unknown, so the flow update time is used to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm. As the first step to validate the superiority of 
P4Update over state-of-the-art algorithms. The amount of data we got was relatively small, on the other hand the sample size of some data was different, we asked our tutor, this was due to the extreme values of the data being filtered 
out. However, by analyzing our limited data, we conclude that this algorithm is superior for different topologies in both flow and single flow cases, and its update time is shorter.
